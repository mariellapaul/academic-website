	abstract = {Becoming a successful speaker depends on acquiring and learning grammatical dependencies between neighboring and non-neighboring linguistic elements (non-adjacent dependencies; {NADs}). Previous studies have demonstrated children’s and adults’ ability to distinguish {NADs} from {NAD} violations right after familiarization. However, demonstrating {NAD} recall after retention is crucial to demonstrate a lasting effect of {NAD} learning. We tested 7-year-olds’ {NAD} learning in a natural, non-native language on one day and {NAD} recall on the next day by means of event-related potentials ({ERPs}). Our results revealed {ERPs} with a more positive amplitude to {NAD} violations than correct {NADs} after familiarization on day one, but {ERPs} with a more negative amplitude to {NAD} violations on day two. This change from more positive to more negative {ERPs} to {NAD} violations possibly indicates that children’s representations of {NADs} changed during an overnight retention period, potentially associated with children’s {NAD} learning. Indeed, our descriptive analyses showed that both {ERP} patterns (i.e., day one: positive, day two: negative) were related to stronger behavioral improvement (i.e., more correct answers on day two compared to day one) in a grammaticality judgment task from day one to day two. We suggest these findings to indicate that children successfully built associative representations of {NADs} on day one and then strengthened these associations during overnight retention, revealing {NAD} recall on day two. The present results suggest that 7-year-olds readily track {NADs} in a natural, non-native language and are able to recall {NADs} after a retention period involving sleep, providing evidence of a lasting effect of {NAD} learning.},

	abstract = {One of the most important social cognitive skills in humans is the ability to “put oneself in someone else’s shoes”, that is, to take another person’s perspective. In socially-situated communication, perspective taking enables the listener to arrive at a meaningful interpretation of what is said (sentence meaning) and what is meant (speaker’s meaning) by the speaker. To successfully decode the speaker’s meaning, the listener has to take into account which information he/she and the speaker share in their common ground ({CG}). We here further investigated competing accounts about when and how {CG} information affects language comprehension by means of reaction time ({RT}) measures, accuracy data, event-related potentials ({ERPs}), and eye-tracking. Early integration accounts would predict that {CG} information is considered immediately and would hence not expect to find costs of {CG} integration. Late integration accounts would predict a rather late and effortful integration of {CG} information during the parsing process that might be reflected in integration or updating costs. Other accounts predict the simultaneous integration of privileged ground ({PG}) and {CG} perspectives. We used a computerized version of the referential communication game with object triplets of different sizes presented visually in {CG} or {PG}. In critical trials (i.e., conflict trials), {CG} information had to be integrated while privileged information had to be suppressed. Listeners mastered the integration of {CG} (response accuracy 99.8\%). Yet, slower {RTs}, and enhanced late positivities in the {ERPs} showed that {CG} integration had its costs. Moreover, eye-tracking data indicated an early anticipation of referents in {CG} but an inability to suppress looks to the privileged competitor, resulting in later and longer looks to targets in those trials, in which {CG} information had to be considered. Our data therefore support accounts that foresee an early anticipation of referents to be in {CG} but a rather late and effortful integration if conflicting information has to be processed. We show that both perspectives, {PG} and {CG}, contribute to socially-situated language processing and discuss the data with reference to theoretical accounts and recent findings on the use of {CG} information for reference resolution.},

	abstract = {{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Abstract{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}In order to become proficient native speakers, children have to learn the grammatical rules of their language. These grammatical rules can define morpho-syntactic relations between neighboring as well as distant elements of a sentence, so-called non-adjacent dependencies ({NADs}). Previous neurophysiological research suggests that {NAD} learning comprises different developmental stages during early childhood. Children up to 2 years of age show evidence of associative {NAD} learning under passive listening conditions, while children starting around the age of 3 to 4 years fail to show learning under passive listening, similarly to the pattern observed in adults. To test whether the transition between these developmental stages occurs in a gradual manner, we tested young children’s {NADlearning} in a foreign language using event-related potentials ({ERPs}). We found {ERP} evidence of {NAD} learning across the age of 1 to 3 years. However, the amplitude of the {ERP} effect indexing {NAD} learning decreased linearly with increasing age. These findings indicatea gradual transition in children’s ability to learn {NADs} associatively under passive listening during early childhood. Cognitively, this transition might be driven by children’s increasing morpho-syntactic knowledge in their native language, hindering {NAD} learning in novel linguistic contexts during passive listening. Neuroanatomically, changes in brain structure might play a crucial role, especially the maturation of the prefrontal cortex, which promotes top-down learning, as opposed to bottom-up, associative learning. In sum, our study provides evidence that {NAD} learning under passive listening conditions undergoes a gradual transition between different developmental stages during early childhood.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Research Highlights{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}Transition between different developmental stages of non-adjacent dependency learning during early childhood evidenced by event-related brain potentials{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Children between 1 and 3 years of age showed learning of non-adjacent dependencies in a foreign language during passive listening{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Brain responses revealed associative non-adjacent dependency learning across the tested age range, triggered by passive listening{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Gradual decrease of the strength of associative non-adjacent dependency learning, during early childhood{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Non-adjacent dependencies ({NADs}) are important building blocks for language and extracting them from the input is a fundamental part of language acquisition. Prior event-related potential ({ERP}) studies revealed changes in the neural signature of {NAD} learning between infancy and adulthood, suggesting a developmental shift in the learning route for {NADs}. The present study aimed to specify which brain regions are involved in this developmental shift and whether this shift extends to {NAD} learning in the non-linguistic domain. In two experiments, 2- and 3-year-old German-learning children were familiarized with either Italian sentences or tone sequences containing {NADs} and subsequently tested with {NAD} violations, while functional near-infrared spectroscopy ({fNIRS}) data were recorded. Results showed increased hemodynamic responses related to the detection of linguistic {NAD} violations in the left temporal, inferior frontal, and parietal regions in 2-year-old children, but not in 3-year-old children. A different developmental trajectory was found for non-linguistic {NADs}, where 3-year-old, but not 2-year-old children showed evidence for the detection of non-linguistic {NAD} violations. These results confirm a developmental shift in the {NAD} learning route and point to distinct mechanisms underlying {NAD} learning in the linguistic and the non-linguistic domain.},

	shorttitle = {Preregistration},
	abstract = {Confirmation bias and pressure to publish may prompt the (unconscious) exploration of various methodological options and reporting only the ones that lead to a (statistically) significant outcome. This undisclosed analytic flexibility increases false positive results and inflates effect sizes, ultimately creating a skewed representation of knowledge. This issue is particularly relevant in {EEG} research, where a myriad of preprocessing and analysis pipelines can be used to extract information from complex multidimensional data. One solution to limit undisclosed analytic flexibility is preregistration: researchers write a time-stamped, publicly accessible research plan with hypotheses, data collection plan, and intended preprocessing and statistical analyses before the start of a research project. In this manuscript, we present an overview of the problems associated with undisclosed analytic flexibility (particularly in human neuroimaging and electrophysiology), discuss why and how {EEG} researchers would benefit from adopting preregistration, provide guidelines and examples on how to preregister data preprocessing and analysis steps in typical {ERP} studies, and conclude by addressing common rebuttals as well as clarifying possibilities and limitations of this open science practice.},
