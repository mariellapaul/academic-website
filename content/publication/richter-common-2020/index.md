abstract: One of the most important social cognitive skills in humans is the ability
  to “put oneself in someone else’s shoes”, that is, to take another person’s perspective.
  In socially-situated communication, perspective taking enables the listener to arrive
  at a meaningful interpretation of what is said (sentence meaning) and what is meant
  (speaker’s meaning) by the speaker. To successfully decode the speaker’s meaning,
  the listener has to take into account which information he/she and the speaker share
  in their common ground (CG). We here further investigated competing accounts about
  when and how CG information affects language comprehension by means of reaction
  time (RT) measures, accuracy data, event-related potentials (ERPs), and eye-tracking.
  Early integration accounts would predict that CG information is considered immediately
  and would hence not expect to find costs of CG integration. Late integration accounts
  would predict a rather late and effortful integration of CG information during the
  parsing process that might be reflected in integration or updating costs. Other
  accounts predict the simultaneous integration of privileged ground (PG) and CG perspectives.
  We used a computerized version of the referential communication game with object
  triplets of different sizes presented visually in CG or PG. In critical trials (i.e.,
  conflict trials), CG information had to be integrated while privileged information
  had to be suppressed. Listeners mastered the integration of CG (response accuracy
  99.8%). Yet, slower RTs, and enhanced late positivities in the ERPs showed that
  CG integration had its costs. Moreover, eye-tracking data indicated an early anticipation
  of referents in CG but an inability to suppress looks to the privileged competitor,
  resulting in later and longer looks to targets in those trials, in which CG information
  had to be considered. Our data therefore support accounts that foresee an early
  anticipation of referents to be in CG but a rather late and effortful integration
  if conflicting information has to be processed. We show that both perspectives,
  PG and CG, contribute to socially-situated language processing and discuss the data
  with reference to theoretical accounts and recent findings on the use of CG information
  for reference resolution.
