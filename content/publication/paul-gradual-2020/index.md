abstract: textlessh3textgreaterAbstracttextless/h3textgreater textlessptextgreaterIn
  order to become proficient native speakers, children have to learn the grammatical
  rules of their language. These grammatical rules can define morpho-syntactic relations
  between neighboring as well as distant elements of a sentence, so-called non-adjacent
  dependencies (NADs). Previous neurophysiological research suggests that NAD learning
  comprises different developmental stages during early childhood. Children up to
  2 years of age show evidence of associative NAD learning under passive listening
  conditions, while children starting around the age of 3 to 4 years fail to show
  learning under passive listening, similarly to the pattern observed in adults. To
  test whether the transition between these developmental stages occurs in a gradual
  manner, we tested young children’s NADlearning in a foreign language using event-related
  potentials (ERPs). We found ERP evidence of NAD learning across the age of 1 to
  3 years. However, the amplitude of the ERP effect indexing NAD learning decreased
  linearly with increasing age. These findings indicatea gradual transition in children’s
  ability to learn NADs associatively under passive listening during early childhood.
  Cognitively, this transition might be driven by children’s increasing morpho-syntactic
  knowledge in their native language, hindering NAD learning in novel linguistic contexts
  during passive listening. Neuroanatomically, changes in brain structure might play
  a crucial role, especially the maturation of the prefrontal cortex, which promotes
  top-down learning, as opposed to bottom-up, associative learning. In sum, our study
  provides evidence that NAD learning under passive listening conditions undergoes
  a gradual transition between different developmental stages during early childhood.textless/ptextgreatertextlessh3textgreaterResearch
