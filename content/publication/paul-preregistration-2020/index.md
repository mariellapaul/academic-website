abstract: 'Confirmation bias and pressure to publish may prompt the (unconscious)
  exploration of various methodological options and reporting only the ones that lead
  to a (statistically) significant outcome. This undisclosed analytic flexibility
  increases false positive results and inflates effect sizes, ultimately creating
  a skewed representation of knowledge. This issue is particularly relevant in EEG
  research, where a myriad of preprocessing and analysis pipelines can be used to
  extract information from complex multidimensional data. One solution to limit undisclosed
  analytic flexibility is preregistration: researchers write a time-stamped, publicly
  accessible research plan with hypotheses, data collection plan, and intended preprocessing
  and statistical analyses before the start of a research project. In this manuscript,
  we present an overview of the problems associated with undisclosed analytic flexibility
  (particularly in human neuroimaging and electrophysiology), discuss why and how
  EEG researchers would benefit from adopting preregistration, provide guidelines
  and examples on how to preregister data preprocessing and analysis steps in typical
  ERP studies, and conclude by addressing common rebuttals as well as clarifying possibilities
  and limitations of this open science practice.'
