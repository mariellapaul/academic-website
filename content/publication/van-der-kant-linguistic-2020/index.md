abstract: Non-adjacent dependencies (NADs) are important building blocks for language
  and extracting them from the input is a fundamental part of language acquisition.
  Prior event-related potential (ERP) studies revealed changes in the neural signature
  of NAD learning between infancy and adulthood, suggesting a developmental shift
  in the learning route for NADs. The present study aimed to specify which brain regions
  are involved in this developmental shift and whether this shift extends to NAD learning
  in the non-linguistic domain. In two experiments, 2- and 3-year-old German-learning
  children were familiarized with either Italian sentences or tone sequences containing
  NADs and subsequently tested with NAD violations, while functional near-infrared
  spectroscopy (fNIRS) data were recorded. Results showed increased hemodynamic responses
  related to the detection of linguistic NAD violations in the left temporal, inferior
  frontal, and parietal regions in 2-year-old children, but not in 3-year-old children.
  A different developmental trajectory was found for non-linguistic NADs, where 3-year-old,
  but not 2-year-old children showed evidence for the detection of non-linguistic
  NAD violations. These results confirm a developmental shift in the NAD learning
  route and point to distinct mechanisms underlying NAD learning in the linguistic
  and the non-linguistic domain.
