abstract: 'Becoming a successful speaker depends on acquiring and learning grammatical
  dependencies between neighboring and non-neighboring linguistic elements (non-adjacent
  dependencies; NADs). Previous studies have demonstrated children’s and adults’ ability
  to distinguish NADs from NAD violations right after familiarization. However, demonstrating
  NAD recall after retention is crucial to demonstrate a lasting effect of NAD learning.
  We tested 7-year-olds’ NAD learning in a natural, non-native language on one day
  and NAD recall on the next day by means of event-related potentials (ERPs). Our
  results revealed ERPs with a more positive amplitude to NAD violations than correct
  NADs after familiarization on day one, but ERPs with a more negative amplitude to
  NAD violations on day two. This change from more positive to more negative ERPs
  to NAD violations possibly indicates that children’s representations of NADs changed
  during an overnight retention period, potentially associated with children’s NAD
  learning. Indeed, our descriptive analyses showed that both ERP patterns (i.e.,
  day one: positive, day two: negative) were related to stronger behavioral improvement
  (i.e., more correct answers on day two compared to day one) in a grammaticality
  judgment task from day one to day two. We suggest these findings to indicate that
  children successfully built associative representations of NADs on day one and then
  strengthened these associations during overnight retention, revealing NAD recall
  on day two. The present results suggest that 7-year-olds readily track NADs in a
  natural, non-native language and are able to recall NADs after a retention period
  involving sleep, providing evidence of a lasting effect of NAD learning.'
