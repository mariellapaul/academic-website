I'm a researcher at University of Göttingen, within the Psychology of Language Group, which is led by Nivedita Mani. In my research, I investigate children's word learning in an active learning framework. In other words, I investigate how children can actively shape which words they learn, for example through their curiostiy and interests. I am also interested in how open science practices can help us improve research practices in infant and EEG research.

I aim to answer these research questions with a combination of methods, including EEG, online studies, and meta-scientific approaches. I strive to make my research open, transparent, and reproducible, by incorporating open science practices in my research.
